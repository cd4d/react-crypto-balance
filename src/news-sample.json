            "body": "Source:Reuters Published: 2017/1/12 21:03:39\nBlockchain enters the real world via anti-establishment wave\nA collection of Bitcoin tokens stand in front of an illustration of binary code in London on January 4. Photo: CFP\nA wave of anti-establishment sentiment sweeping the Western world is likely to help push blockchain - the technology that gave birth to the digital currency Bitcoin - out of cyberspace and into the real world in 2017.\nBlockchain, which allows the Web-based currency to function, has attracted some big backers who have risen to prominence partly because of their rejection of traditional power structures - like Bitcoin itself.\nNow they are looking at a wide range of new uses for the technology, with those outside the realm of finance expected to grow most.\nFor example, Italy's biggest opposition group, the 5-Star Movement, wants blockchain to be used in streamlining public services. In the United States, President-elect Donald Trumphas a number of enthusiasts for the technology in his inner circle.\nExperts caution that blockchain still needs several years of experimentation and development, much like the early days of the Internet, and that some projects will never work.\nNevertheless, in an ironic departure from blockchain's libertarian origins, the very establishment that early supporters hoped it would displace is also jumping on the bandwagon.\nMany of the world's biggest banks and corporations are trying to harness the technology to make the likes of transacting cross-border payments, issuing debt and recording health data more efficient. Even Britain's Conservative government is keen to get in on the act.\nBlockchain allows for transactions and data transfers to be completed in seconds through a peer-to-peer computer network, with no need for a third party.\nIt has therefore attracted those who distrust established authority, such as the central banks that issue traditional currencies.\nThis is particularly the case in the first implementation of Bitcoin, which outperformed all conventional currencies in 2016. Iceland's Pirate Party, the country's joint second-biggest party, wants Bitcoin to be accepted as legal tender.\nSpirit of 2016\nNotwithstanding the corporate interest, blockchain reflects the spirit of the past year when disgruntled Britons rejected the European Union, Italians brought down their prime minister and Americans elected Trump.\n\"A global and open blockchain ... lends itself very well to current anti-establishment sentiment,\" said Jon Matonis, an economist and founding director of the Bitcoin Foundation.\n\"The general theme is removing the role of a third-party auditor or enforcement agency.\"\nStill, it was the financial services industry that moved fastest on blockchain development in 2016, looking for ways to reduce costs and cut the time it takes to settle financial transactions.\nSome of these applications are expected to move from the laboratory and into operation this year. But 2017 also looks likely to be the year when other sectors, both public and private, find new \"use-cases\" via which they can adopt the technology.\n\"You're still going to see more and more use-cases and resources being put into financial services, so that pie will still grow. But a larger percentage of use-cases ... will be non-financial,\" said Nick Williamson, CEO of Credits, a London-based blockchain infrastructure provider.\nWilliamson said countries were looking at using blockchain for improving transparency and accountability in public services. The British government, for example, is examining whether it could help to track welfare and pension payments.\nAnti-establishment politics\nIn Italy, the 5-Star Movement - which presents itself as a clean alternative to mainstream parties dogged by corruption probes - has called blockchain a \"fundamental topic\" that could bring about more trust in the public sector.\n5-Star plans to propose a law in the Lazio region this month forcing the local government to use blockchain in streamlining and bringing greater transparency to some of its activities, according to a draft seen by Reuters.\nIf successful, this would be the first law in Italy to incorporate the use of blockchain in government. The group also wants to introduce the technology in a regional healthcare reform, 5-star councillor Davide Barillari told Reuters.\nIn the US, the blockchain sector hopes projects will gain momentum thanks to support from the incoming Trump administration.\nThey say the technology could help run public-sector processes more efficiently, through better tracking of government agencies' spending or reducing welfare fraud.\nAs a property billionaire, Trump's anti-establishment credentials are open to question, but he has presented himself as a political outsider, and has appointed blockchain and Bitcoin champion Congressman Mick Mulvaney as budget director.\nMulvaney, who co-founded the Blockchain Caucus in Congress in September to allow lawmakers to coordinate policies on using blockchain, calls the technology a \"tremendous revolution\".\nTrump has also chosen Goldman Sachs president Gary Cohn, whose bank has invested in blockchain, as director of the National Economic Council. Billionaire tech investor and Bitcoin enthusiast Peter Thiel is a member of the transition team.\n\"Mystical Capabilities\"\nFor all this support, some feel blockchain has been over-hyped.\n\"It took on quite mystical capabilities this [past] year. I kept reading things on the Internet about how it would solve poverty and eliminate hunger,\" said Dave Birch, a director of innovation at consultancy Consult Hyperion.\n\"A lot of people said they would get into blockchain because they thought it was sort of magic.\"\nMany in the financial technology industry, Birch included, say it is important not to expect too much too soon.\n\"Many blockchain platforms announced the beginning of projects in 2016 that will never be completed. In some cases, the technology simply didn't work. In others, implementation is taking longer than expected,\" said Adam Krellenstein, co-founder of blockchain start-up Symbiont.\nStill, experts hope the doubts will be dispelled as some of the smaller-scale projects - especially in the financial services sector, which has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into blockchain - are put into operation.\n\"2016 was a year of 'proofs of concept'; 2017 is much more likely to be a year of implementations,\" said IBM's global head of financial markets in London, Keith Bear.\nReuters",

            "body": "BUSINESS WIRE\n)Strike, the worlds leading digital wallet built on Bitcoins Lightning Network, welcomes legislation announced today to make El Salvador the worlds first sovereign nation to adopt bitcoin as legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar. This move will help unleash the power and potential of Bitcoin for everyday use cases on an open network that benefits individuals, businesses, and public sector services.\nStrike founder and CEO Jack Mallers, one of the earliest Lightning Network developers, has been providing market insights to help make El Salvadors world-changing effort successful and build the countrys modern financial infrastructure using Bitcoin technology. This technology delivers powerful advantages over legacy financial rails and incumbent payment systems.\nSpeaking from Bitcoin 2021 in Miami, Mallers said, This is the shot heard round the world for Bitcoin. Whats transformative here is that bitcoin is both the greatest reserve asset ever created and a superior monetary network. Holding bitcoin provides a way to protect developing economies from potential shocks of fiat currency inflation. Additionally, adopting a natively digital currency as legal tender provides El Salvador the most secure, efficient and globally integrated open payments network in the world.\nPresident Bukele announced El Salvadors intention to make bitcoin legal tender in a video broadcast to Bitcoin 2021.\nMaking bitcoin legal tender is a leapfrog moment that can help countries like El Salvador shift from a largely cash economy to an innovative, inclusive, and transparent digital economy where your bank account is your phone. That is especially meaningful in El Salvador, where about 70% of people do not have bank accounts or credit cards. In addition, remittances account for more than 20% of El Salvadors GDP, and incumbent services can charge 10% or more in fees for international transfers that take days to arrive and must be collected from a physical location. That amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars a year that people could save or spend with local businesses in their communities  demonstrating the powerful use cases and addressable market opportunities from scaling Bitcoin and the Lightning Network for everyday uses.\nEl Salvador has assembled Bitcoin leaders across the world to help build a new financial ecosystem with Bitcoin as the base layer. It was an inevitability, but here already: the first country on track to make bitcoin legal tender. Another milestone for Bitcoin and El Salvador. Were pleased to help El Salvador on its journey towards adoption of the Bitcoin Standard, stated Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream, who plans to contribute technologies like Liquid and satellite infrastructure to make El Salvador a model for the world.\nStrikes mobile payments app launched in El Salvador in March and quickly became the number one downloaded app in the country. Strikes vision is to build a more connected financial world by making the Bitcoin network easily accessible and useful. Strike expects to enter several more markets in coming months. Once governments see the benefits of Bitcoin technologies like Strike on financial efficiency and inclusion, it becomes obvious that they will seek to follow in the footsteps of El Salvador.\nAbout Strike\nStrike is a mobile payments app that allows users to send and receive money anywhere, instantly, for free. Strike is built on top of the Bitcoin network  the largest global, interoperable, and open payments standard. Strike believes that open payment networks enable universal participation in the financial system, ushering in a new digital economy with truly borderless money transfers. Strike leverages Bitcoins open payment network to offer users the first global peer-to-peer payments app and a novel bitcoin-native financial experience.

            "body": ",\nJune 5, 2021\n/PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Blockstream, a Bitcoin infrastructure startup, today announced their collaborative effort with Square, Inc., the financial services and digital payments company headed by\nJack Dorsey\n, to build an open-source, solar-powered Bitcoin mining facility at one of Blockstream's mining sites in\nthe United States\n.\nTogether, they plan to provide public transparency by sharing details of the project economics and the knowledge gained from building a Bitcoin mine powered by renewable energy. Ultimately, the project is designed to raise awareness and show how bitcoin mining in conjunction with renewable energy can help drive the clean energy transition.\nSquare intends to invest\n$5M\nin the facility, with Blockstream providing infrastructure and expertise to build and manage the project. The facility will be a proof-of-concept for a 100% renewable energy Bitcoin mine at scale, with the economics of the build-outincluding operational costs and ROImade open to the public.\n\"Many mining operations throughout the world, including our own, already rely on renewable energy because it is the most cost-effective power available. Together with Square, we hope that the open and transparent nature of the project will become a model that other businesses can learn from,\" said\nChris Cook\n, Chief Information Officer and head of Mining at Blockstream. \"We're hoping to demonstrate that a renewable mining facility in the real world is not only possible but also empirically prove that Bitcoin accelerates the world toward a sustainable future.\"\nThe solar-powered mining project is also designed to be scalable, enabling Blockstream to add additional capacity and support more participants to significantly expand renewable mining operations in the future.\n\"We're thrilled to partner with Blockstream to provide an open-source working model for our combined thesis that Bitcoin can further accelerate the renewable energy transition,\" said\nNeil Jorgensen\n, Global ESG Lead at Square, Inc. \"The project will serve as an ongoing, transparent case study that will allow us to all learn together the specific unit economics of clean energy Bitcoin mining. We can't wait to start sharing our results with the community.\"\nIn addition to providing regular reports on the project's economics, Blockstream is building a freely accessible dashboard showing real-time metrics of the project's performance, including power output and bitcoin mined.\nThe dashboard, based on technology developed for the Blockstream Mining Note (BMN), aims to be available 24/7 from any browser, providing the industry with a real-world, real-time case study of a renewable energy Bitcoin mine.\nMedia Contact",
